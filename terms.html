                <h2>Loan Terms and Conditions</h2>
                
                <h3>Application Process</h3>
                <p>
                    By submitting a loan application through the Platform, you authorize Tribal Installment Loans to verify the information you provide and to conduct credit checks and background investigations as permitted by law. You consent to us obtaining information about you from credit bureaus, financial institutions, and other third parties to evaluate your creditworthiness and ability to repay.
                </p>

                <h3>Loan Approval and Funding</h3>
                <p>
                    Approval of your loan application is at the sole discretion of Tribal Installment Loans. We may approve, deny, or approve with modified terms any application without providing a detailed explanation. Upon approval and your acceptance of the loan terms, funds will be deposited into the bank account you designated during the application process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The timing of fund disbursement depends on various factors, including verification of information, banking processing times, and compliance with applicable laws. While we strive to process approved loans quickly, we do not guarantee same-day funding.
                </p>

                <h3>Interest Rates and Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    The interest rate, fees, and other charges applicable to your loan will be clearly disclosed in your loan agreement before you are obligated to accept the loan. All rates and fees are calculated in accordance with applicable state and tribal lending laws. You acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand all charges associated with your loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Late payment fees, prepayment penalties (if applicable), and other charges will be disclosed in your loan agreement. By accepting the loan, you agree to pay all interest, fees, and charges as outlined in your loan agreement.
                </p>

                <h3>Repayment Obligations</h3>
                <p>
                    You agree to repay the full amount of your loan, including all interest and fees, according to the repayment schedule specified in your loan agreement. Payments must be made by the due date specified in your agreement. Failure to make timely payments may result in late fees, increased interest rates, collection actions, and negative impacts on your credit score.
                </p>
